function dst = bw2sdtrf(bwimg, sc)
% BW2SDTRF compute a signed distance transform 
%   dst = bw2sdtrf(bwimg) computes the signed distance transform from the surface between the
%   binary elements of logical bwimg, which can be of any dimentions that bwdist accepts. 
%   By default, the distance computation assumes isotropic voxels. 
%
%   dst = bw2sdtrf(bwimg, voxSize). allows for specification of non-isotropic voxel size. In this
%   case, bwdistsc (by Yuriy Mishchenko - see MATLAB Central File Exchange) will be used instead of 
%   bwdist. 
%
%   Note: the distance transform on either side of the surface will be +1/-1 (or whatever ths 
%   size is) - i.e. there are no voxels for which the dst should be 0.
%   
%   Runtime: currently the function uses bwdist/bwdistsc twice. If there is a quick way to 
%   compute the surface, bwdist could be used only once.
